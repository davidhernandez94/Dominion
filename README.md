# Dominion
### Scenario
This project aims to create a virtual space where 2-4 users can sign in to an account or play as guests, and play the beloved deck-building game **Dominion**. 
### Design Paradigm
Users play against each other in a *pass and play* format, so that players can be at the same device. The **Dominion** rulebook is very long and complicated, so here is a link to the rules:

### Expected Output
The user is able to play with commands directly into the terminal of the project. All output of the game are also in the terminal, using pure text to communicate with the program.
